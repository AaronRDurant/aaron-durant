            Howdy! I'm Aaron Durant, an aspiring front-end web developer in
            Michigan. This is my tiny spot on the internet where I share{" "}
            <Link to="/projects">projects</Link> I've made and things I{" "}
            <Link to="/blog">write</Link>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I come to the land of web development from the adjacent nation of
            online publishing. In working on a motorsports journalism project
            simply for the love of it for five years, I developed a deep
            interest in the intersection of web design and content through
            attending three dozen motorsports events and publishing more than
            1,000 articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Realizing I preferred improving the design of{" "}
            <a

            >
              The Apex
            </a>{" "}
            instead of writing for it, I knew I needed to make a change. So,
            after a year-long project-based online bootcamp and several months
            of additional self-directed learning, I aim to start in my first
            role as a front-end developer in 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy reading, biking, weight training, playing golf, playing
            drums, snowboarding, and spending time with my girlfriend and
            family. I also really love motocross.
