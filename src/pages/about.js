          <p>Howdy! I'm Aaron Durant, an aspiring front-end web developer in Michigan. This is my tiny spot on the internet where I display <Link to="/projects">projects</Link> I've made and <Link to="/blog">write</Link>.</p>
          <p>I come to the land of web development from the adjacent nation of online publishing. Though I halted my five-year pursuit of a motorsports journalism career, my experience enables me to bring forward invaluable lessons on good writing, effective communication, and general business.</p>
          <p>I knew I needed to make a change when I realized I preferred tinkering in WordPress with the design of <a href="https://www.theapex.racing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Apex</a> over writing for it. After a yearlong project-based online bootcamp and several months of additional self-directed learning, I aim to start in my first role as a front-end developer in 2022.</p>
          <p>Away from my laptop, I enjoy reading, snowboarding, playing drums, and spending time with my girlfriend and family. I also really love motocross.</p>
