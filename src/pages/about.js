            Howdy! I'm Aaron Durant, a software developer in Michigan. This is
            my spot on the internet for sharing things I make and write.
          </p>
          <p>
            In working on a motorsports journalism project simply for the love
            of it for five years, I developed a deep interest in the
            intersection of web design and content through attending three dozen
            motorsports events and publishing more than 1,000 articles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Realizing I preferred improving the design of{" "}
            <a
              href="https://www.theapex.racing/"

            >
              The Apex
            </a>{" "}
            instead of writing for it, I knew I needed to make a change. So,
            after a year-long project-based online bootcamp and several months
            of additional self-directed learning, I started in my first role as
            a software developer in July 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy playing golf, drumming, biking, weight training,
            snowboarding, and spending time with my girlfriend and family. I
            also really love motocross.
