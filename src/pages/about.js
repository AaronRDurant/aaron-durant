                  Coding and motocross have been my main focuses since 2020.
                  Everything came together in the second half of 2022 when I
                  started my software development career in July and, in
                  October, lapped a motocross track for the first time since
                  2008.

                  Between 2015 and 2020, I attended over three dozen motorsports
                  events across North America with media credentials and
                  published more than 1,500 articles on{" "}

                  I also enjoy playing drums, playing golf, snowboarding, taking
