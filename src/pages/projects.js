                  and tracking the progress of my primary endeavor outside my

                  furthering my career, and improving my fitness and skill to

                  I made a sports dictionary in second grade, an animal magazine
                  in third grade, a newspaper in fifth grade, and a Twitter
                  account and blog about IndyCar in eighth grade. I also started
                  a band with my brother at some point. (Not to mention the
                  Nitro Circus-esque front-yard action sports video series my
                  brothers and I started; it never quite took off.)

                  Perhaps not, but I'll admit I was one of <i>those</i> kids who
                  did lots of extracurricular stuff growing up. I'd bet on young
                  people like that 10 times out of 10; I would be very different
                  now if I weren't so curious as a kid.
