                  with my friend Ben Hinc in 2015. I stepped away to focus on
                  web development in 2020 and attempted to return in 2023, but
                  my hands are full with coding and motocross.

                  I made a sports dictionary in second grade, an animal magazine
                  in third grade, a newspaper in fifth grade, a Twitter account
                  and blog about IndyCar in eighth grade, and I also started a
                  band with my brother at some point. (Not to mention the Nitro
                  Circus-esque front-yard action sports video series my brothers
                  and I started; it never quite took off.)

                  Perhaps not, but I'll admit I was one of <i>those</i> kids who
                  did lots of extracurricular stuff growing up. I'll bet on
                  young people like that 10 times out of 10; I would be very
                  different now if I weren't so curious as a kid.
