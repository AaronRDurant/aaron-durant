                  is my motocross YouTube channel, where I document the journey
                  of growing as an amateur racer. Through racing highlights and
                  lessons learned, it offers an honest look at the challenges
                  and triumphs of pursuing my passion for motocross.

                  I made a sports dictionary in second grade, an animal magazine
                  in third grade, a newspaper in fifth grade, and a Twitter
                  account and blog about IndyCar in eighth grade. I also started
                  a band with my brother at some point. (Not to mention the
                  Nitro Circus-esque front-yard action sports video series my
                  brothers and I started; it never quite took off.)

                  Perhaps not, but I'll admit I was one of <i>those</i> kids who
                  did lots of extracurricular stuff growing up. I'd bet on young
                  people like that 10 times out of 10; I would be very different
                  now if I weren't so curious as a kid.
