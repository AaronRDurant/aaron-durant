This edition of my personal website ends a long line of WordPress sites I created but never really maintained. More important is that it lays the groundwork for future revisions as I further my skills and continue following my interests in web development.

I learned so much between getting started by cloning a Gatsby starter in late 2021 and deploying this website on Netlify in May 2022. Beyond consistently (theoretically 😳) publishing blog posts written in Markdown, there are a few other things I'm already aiming to add or improve...

## To Do ✅

- Dark mode 🌃 🌙
- A more striking layout for the lists of blog posts and projects
- Unique image meta tag for each blog post
- Responsiveness improvements for some device sizes

That's not to mention an ultra-minimalist design I'm beginning to develop for a version 2.0, which I'm planning to complete in time for my birthday in March 2023!
