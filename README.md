Completed in late January 2023, this website's current design marked the first major revision to my Gatsby-powered little corner of the internet, which I initially launched in May 2022.

Eight months on, none of the technology behind the website changed — it's still using the Gatsby framework, Markdown files continue to drive the blog via GraphQL, and it remains hosted on Netlify. For now, I intend to stick with the current look and put time toward writing more blog posts.

## To Do ✅

Beyond potentially adding dark mode, I'll leave the design alone until I feel ready to work on version 3.0. I'm kicking around the idea of devising an ultra-minimalist look to deploy for 2024 — we'll see!
