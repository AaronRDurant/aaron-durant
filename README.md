This latest edition of my personal website ends a long line of WordPress sites I created but never really maintained. More important is that it lays the groundwork for future revisions as I further my skills and continue following my interests in web development.

I learned so much between getting started by cloning a Gatsby starter in late 2021 and deploying this website on Netlify in late May 2022. Beyond consistently (theoretically 😳) publishing blog posts written in Markdown, there are a few other things I'm already aiming to add or improve...

## To Do ✅

- Dark mode! 🌃 🌙
- Unique descriptions for each page to improve SEO
- A more exciting layout for the blog post list — plus pagination
- Social media buttons on the front page
- Responsiveness improvements for some device sizes
- Potentially set up automatic updating for dependencies and add end-to-end testing

That's not to mention a super minimalist design I'm beginning to develop for a version 2.0, perhaps in time for the start of 2023!
