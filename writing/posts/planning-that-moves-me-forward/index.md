Have you ever felt like you're spinning your wheels, trying everything but going nowhere? That's where I've been — until now. Hopefully.

I'd set goals, make plans, and start strong — only to lose momentum when life inevitably got in the way. Over time, I'd abandon my plans, frustrated by my inability to follow through. The cycle repeated, and I became increasingly unsure whether my goals were even possible.

Recently, I've spent a lot of time trying to understand what's held me back. My struggles often come down to two things: **fear** and an **inflexible approach to planning**. Fear of failure, climbing the wrong ladder, or discovering that even my best effort might not be enough. Pair that with rigid plans that fall apart as soon as life throws a curveball — or even a totally hittable fastball right down the middle — and it’s no wonder I’ve struggled to find consistent progress.

But today, I'm deploying a new strategy. These ideas feel like the missing piece of my puzzle, and starting now, I'm ready to put them into action. Here's how I'm reframing my approach to fear, focus, and progress.

## Reframing My Beliefs

For years, I've held myself back with limiting beliefs such as:

- _I can't sustain focus on difficult subjects and tasks._
- _I'm not skilled enough to succeed in coding._
- _I'm too far behind to compete in motocross._

These thoughts aren't facts — they're stories I've told myself. And while they feel authentic in the moment, they're not permanent.

To move forward, I've started creating new beliefs that challenge the old ones. For example:

- _I can focus when I break my work into structured, intentional blocks of time._
- _I can become skilled at coding by consistently practicing and building projects._
- _My improvement in motocross proves I can keep advancing._

With these new beliefs guiding me, I can take practical steps forward without being held back by doubt. Each time I see myself in a new light, I create space for progress — and I can already feel the shift beginning.

## Turning Progress Into Tangible Steps

In the past, my goals needed to be more specific to act on. I'd tell myself, _"I want to get better at coding,"_ or _"I want to be faster on my dirt bike,"_ but I never defined what "better" or "faster" meant in practical terms.

Now, I'm focusing on actionable steps. Progress doesn't have to mean achieving the end goal tomorrow — it means taking the next step. For coding, that might mean completing a module in an online course. For motocross, it might mean clearing one new jump at the track.

Tangible milestones give me direction, but they're also flexible. I can adjust without abandoning the plan if life gets in the way. The important thing is to keep moving forward, even if it's slower than I'd like.

## Planning That Works With, Not Against, You

This is the part I'm most excited about: building a planning system that works for me, rather than against me.

In the past, I thought of planning as rigid and unforgiving. If I blocked out time for something and life got in the way, I'd feel like I'd failed. That feeling led to frustration and, eventually, giving up altogether.

I've realized that planning doesn't have to be perfect — it just has to provide structure. I can block out time for essential tasks while leaving room for flexibility. If a plan changes, it's not a failure; it's an opportunity to adjust and keep going.

Consistency matters more than perfection. I don't need to crush every day — I just need to show up more often than not. By focusing on progress over perfection, I'm building a system that supports me instead of defeating me.

## Building Habits That Stick

Success doesn't come from overhauling everything overnight — it's the result of gradual, consistent changes that build momentum.

For me, this looks like focusing on a few essential habits:

- Structuring my work into focused blocks of time.
- Prioritizing physical fitness and nutrition.
- Regularly reflecting on what's working and what's not.

These habits aren't complicated, but they require intention. The key is showing up every day, even if it's just for a little while. Small actions build momentum, and momentum leads to significant results over time.

## Moving Forward

I don't have all the answers. I haven't turned my life around with these strategies — yet. But I believe they're a significant missing piece of the puzzle.

Starting today, I'm committing to this new approach. I'll embrace flexibility in my plans, challenge my old beliefs, and focus on small, meaningful actions. I'll move forward one step at a time, confident that progress is possible.

This revised method is the beginning of something better — more productivity, more progress, and hopefully more blog posts, with a better frequency than my three over the last two and a half years. I'm taking these first steps with hope and purpose, trusting that they'll lead me somewhere worth going over time.

If you've ever felt stuck or unsure how to move forward, I hope this resonates with you. Progress doesn't happen all at once — it happens one step at a time.
